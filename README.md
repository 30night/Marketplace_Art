<h2>Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.</h2>
 Starshopping is an marketplace that is intended to be a medium for new people that want to start showing off their work to a community that is understanding much like the freelance programming industry artists are somtimes manipulated by customer and underpaid for their work and even if you keep the art and not getting paid you have spent time and recorces on somthing that now might not sell having a legitmate market place where customers pay upfront and get what they paid for would be benifical as the transaction would be quick and simple as the customer views the artists work and then can purchase without the two ever needing to contact each other.

<h2>Why is it a problem that needs solving?</h2>
It is a problem that need solving as free lance artists are always on the bad sides of deals gone sour and there not meny dedicated marketplaces for artist with and not just for paint are but any art that individuals want to express themselves in. this isn't for crazy expensive are jsut for peole that enjoy creating or people that have a hobby that they want to sustain by crating and selling there are sites like gumtree and facebook marketplace but i find that those are so saturated with other items that it is sometimes hard to advertise your art also it doesn't hurt to advertise yourself on as many platforms as possible

 <h2>User stories for your app</h2>

 Pablo Picasso- 
 I just do art as a hobby but most sites that i can sell my artwork on are not dedicated to just art creations like ebay, gumtree, facebook marketplace, craigslist although all i can sell my art on these sites there is so many items on these sites that it is hard for my work to be seen by people who appreciate my work its also hard to sell on these sites as people try to bargain for my hard work which is really demoralizing as i set the price i do because i believe that it is worth that much. using starshopping gives me an easier way to deal with selling my work as i can jsut put up the work and forget about it without having to worry about customers trying to bargain with me.

Leonardo da vinci-
Id like to think of myself as somewhat of an inventor but all my creations come at a cost for materals and such so in order to keep on makinh things i somtimes sell my creations to make a little bit of side cash to keep on inventing starshopping is a phenominal website i can use to list my items in order to sell and keep on making things
